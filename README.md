# The PHP Interpreter

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to
web development. Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your
blog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the
[PHP License v3.01](LICENSE).

## PHP extensions

Extensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many
essential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP
Extension Community Library - [PECL](https://pecl.php.net).

## Contributing

The PHP source code is located in the Git repository at
[github.com/php/php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src). Contributions are most
welcome by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Discussions are done on GitHub, but depending on the topic can also be relayed
to the official PHP developer mailing list internals@lists.php.net.

New features require an RFC and must be accepted by the developers. See
[Request for comments - RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc) and
[Voting on PHP features](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting) for more information
on the process.

Bug fixes don't require an RFC. If the bug has a GitHub issue, reference it in
the commit message using `GH-NNNNNN`. Use `#NNNNNN` for tickets in the old
[bugs.php.net](https://bugs.php.net) bug tracker.
